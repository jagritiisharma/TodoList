#Here are the step-by-step instructions to run a React.js project, assuming you've switched to the `TodoList` directory and need to install `react-scripts`:

1. *Switch to TodoList Directory:*
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `TodoList` directory. Use the `cd` command:
   ```
   cd TodoList
   ```

2. *Install React Scripts:*
   Once you're inside the `TodoList` directory, use npm to install `react-scripts`. This package provides scripts and configurations used by Create React App, which is a popular tool for setting up React projects:
   ```
   npm install react-scripts
   ```
   This command will download and install `react-scripts` and its dependencies.

3. *Start the Development Server:*
   After installing `react-scripts`, you can start the development server using npm's `start` script. This script is typically provided by Create React App and launches the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This command will compile your React code and start a development server. It will also open your default web browser to preview the project. If it doesn't open automatically, you can visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.


By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run the React.js project located in the `TodoList` directory after installing `react-scripts`.
